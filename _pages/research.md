I'm a computer vision enthusiast with research interests in
2D and 3D object tracking and detection, image-segmentation and AR/VR. 


<h2>Project highlights and overview{% include scroll_top %}</h2>

1. <h3 style="text-align:left;">
    Image Segmentation from satellite imagery
    <span style="float:right;">
        Jan 2017 - July 2019
    </span> </h3>
   
    The objective of the project was to extract map features from satellite imagery, with a primary focus on extracting building footprints. The goal was to achieve a model that could perform instance segmentation, separating building boundaries, and be sufficiently generalized to identify both small and large buildings.<br>\
    Dual-scale training was used to learn the representation of both small and large buildings. This setup was tried on the Inria dataset and an Intersection over Union (IOU) score of **76.98** (*"the score reported is the result of the submission made in 2019"*).
   
2. <h3 style="text-align:left;">
    Computer vision assisted real-time map making
    <span style="float:right;">
        May 2019 - Jan 2020
    </span> </h3>
    
    The aim of the project was to create an efficient application that could link existing map-making tools with computer vision-trained models. The application aimed to automate as much of the mapping process as possible to streamline the map-making process.

   Object detection and tracking in changing weather conditions
    <span style="float:right;">
        Oct 2022 - Apr 2023
    </span> </h3>

    The aim of the project was to address the challenges faced by computer vision systems in detecting and tracking objects under diverse weather conditions, specifically focusing on tracking cars from a stationary camera mounted on the road. The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of various weather scenarios on existing detection-tracking architectures.\
   &nbsp;<br>
   **Project Highlights:**
   1. Exploring the difficulties associated with accurately detecting and tracking objects in changing weather conditions.
   2. Evaluating the performance of a selected tracking by detection architecture under different weather scenarios. 
   3. Identifying limitations of model that performs well in clear weather but struggle in severe weather conditions. 
   4. Conducting a comparative analysis between selected tracking by detection based and joint detection-tracking approaches.
