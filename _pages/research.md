## Research Overview
I'm a senior scientist coordinating the __Learning, Recognition & Surveillance__ workgroup at the __Institut of Computer Graphics & Vision__.
My PhD research focused on visual object tracking, leveraging __a priori__/context information for generic single object tracking, as well as multi-object tracking algorithms.
Currently, my research interests include (multiple) object tracking and detection in both 2D and 3D, human behavior analysis, and video analysis in general.
