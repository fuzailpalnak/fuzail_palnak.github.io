I'm a computer vision enthusiast with research interests in
object tracking and detection in both 2D and 3D, image segmentation and optimisation techniques.


<h2>Project highlights and overview{% include scroll_top %}</h2>

1. <h3 style="text-align:left;">
    Image Segmentation from satellite imagery
    <span style="float:right;">
        Jan 2017 - July 2019
    </span> </h3>
   
    The objective of the project was to extract map features from satellite imagery, where I primarily worked on extracting building
    footprint from satellite imagery with the goal to achieve a model that could perform 
    instance segmentation, or boundary separation and was sufficiently generalized to identify small and large buildings. 

    We experimented with several criterion functions in order to accomplish boundary separation, and dual scale training was used to 
    learn the representation of small and large buildings. We tried this setup on Inria dataset and achieved an IOU score of **76.98** (*"the score reported is the result of the submission made in 2019"*).

2. <h3 style="text-align:left;">
    Computer vision assisted real-time map making
    <span style="float:right;">
        May 2019 - Jan 2020
    </span> </h3>
    
    The goal of the project was to design and develop an efficient application that could bridge the gap between 
existing map-making tools and computer vision trained models. The application's main objective was to automate as much of the map-making process as possible.
